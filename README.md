# Web Scraper for Amazon Laundry Machines Products
 This project aims to collect data from Amazon's retail products: Washers and Dryers

 The application was thought in a way that should be easy to adapt for other products and different regions.

 It gives you a csv with the information. If cleaning and translation is needed, address the Routine.ipynb and run it, should eliminate extra columns, merge columns that have the same content and translate the items (thinking about importing it on Sheets)
